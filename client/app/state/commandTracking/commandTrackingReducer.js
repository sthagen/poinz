 * For every command we send, let's store it in our client state as "pending command".
 * various view components are then able to display "spinners" when waiting for the corresponding backend event.
 * limitations:
 *  - the first event produced by a command will remove it (consider that the backend might produce N events for a single command that is processed)
 *  - if the backend does not produce an event for a command, the command will remain in the client state.
 *
 *  It is also crucial for the join-room flow. We need to know which "roomJoined" event is ours. We cannot rely on the userId. For first-time-users (no presets yet), we don't have a userId.
 *  Thus we save our commandId, when we send a "joinRoom" command.
