/**
 * quite similar like the original "combineReducers" from redux.
 * (Without the dev/test env warnings)
 *
 * Main difference:  we pass the own userId from the current state as third argument to each reducer!
 * This allows every reducer to check whether a userId from an event matches our own.
 * Alternatively, we could have reduced own userId to every portion of the state, which is cumbersome.
